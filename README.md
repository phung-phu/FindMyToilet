# Project Description
## [FindMyToilet](https://projects.invisionapp.com/share/S2P5G22W3MQ#/screens)

The prototype is viewable at: https://projects.invisionapp.com/share/S2P5G22W3MQ#/screens

We hope that this app will be useful to everyone since finding a clean toilet is an issue that everyone has faced at some point or another. We hope to integrate many filters to help our users find exactly what they’re looking for. 

This is an actual issue since in many places finding toilets that are disability accessible is hard. Filters that allow the user to check the nearest bathroom with a baby table in the men’s room can help out parents and guardians in messy situations. We also see this app being extremely helpful to tourists in countries where they’re not familiar with the culture or where there is a language barrier.
